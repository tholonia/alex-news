Schrödinger's Negentropy refers to a state of increased order or organization in open systems that are capable of energy storage, which is characterized by an equal distribution of energy across all space-time domains (the 'k = const.' regime). This concept aligns with the idea of Negentropy as it describes a system's tendency towards greater complexity and organized structure. In Schrödinger's view, this state represents not only maximum entropy but also minimum entropy due to the effective coupling of activities across space-time domains. The abstract suggests that such systems exhibit coherence and coupled cycles, which are indicative of a thermodynamics of organized complexity where Negentropy plays a central role in maintaining order amidst energy flow far from equilibrium.


To further elaborate on this concept within the context of Schrödinger's work:

Negentropy is a term that originates from Erwin Schrödinger, who introduced it as part of his exploration into what constitutes life and organization in physical systems. In his book "What is Life?", Schrödinger proposed the idea that living organisms are examples of Negentropic processes—systems that maintain or increase their level of order against the natural tendency towards disorder (entropy).

The abstract from Mae-Wan Ho's work on BioThermoKinetics and thermodynamics of organized complexity extends this idea by discussing how open systems with energy storage capabilities can exhibit Negentropic behavior. These systems, through coupled cycles and coherence across space-time domains, reach a state where entropy is minimized while potential degrees of freedom are maximized—a condition that Schrödinger would likely associate with the essence of life's organization.
 Written by Mae-Wan Ho at The Institute of Science in Society, this abstract suggests an interdisciplinary approach to understanding Negentropy within a broader thermodynamic framework, emphasizing its relevance to living systems and their complex behaviors.
