Schrödinger's concept of Negentropy refers to a measure of order or negentropic energy in a system that can be related to thermodynamics and organized complexity. In the context of Mae-Wan Ho's article, Negentropy is discussed as an aspect of energy storage within open systems far from equilibrium, which exhibit coherence and structured space-time organization. The concept suggests that these systems have symmetrited coupled cycles, indicating a level of organized complexity where different parts of the system are interdependent and can store energy in ways that contribute to maintaining or increasing order (negentropy) within the system as a whole. This idea aligns with Schrödinger's broader work on quantum mechanics and his views on the role of negentropic forces in biological systems, where he proposed that life is maintained by such forces counteracting entropy.
