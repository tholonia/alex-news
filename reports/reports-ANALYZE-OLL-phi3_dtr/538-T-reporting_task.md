Schrödinger's Negentropy refers to a concept introduced by Mae-Wan Ho that explores the thermodynamics of organized complexity. It suggests that living systems exhibit properties such as energy storage, coherence, and symmetrical coupled cycles which are indicative of an ordered state far from equilibrium. This order is maintained through continuous energy flow, leading to a regime characterized by maximum entropy (SG = -kSj pj In pj) while simultaneously being the state of minimum entropy due to effective coupling across space-time domains. The concept emphasizes that such systems are at an extremum state where potential degrees of freedom are maximized and activities in all space-time domains are coherently coupled, which is a departure from traditional thermodynamic views on free energy and organization. References include E. Schrödinger's "What is Life?" (1944) and L. Brillouin's work on information theory as it relates to science.
