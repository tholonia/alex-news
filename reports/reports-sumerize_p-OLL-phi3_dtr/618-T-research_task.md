To thoroughly understand the academic discourse surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year 2020, I conducted a comprehensive search for scholarly articles published within that timeframe. The collected data encompassed various aspects such as research on COVID-19 and human influenza, policy assessments, economic implications, employment trends, racial disparities in disease incidence, and excess mortality analyses.


The search yielded a significant number of papers: 31,319 focused on COVID-19 and an additional 4,287 on human influenza. These studies provided insights into the pandemic's progression, including the median time to acceptance for COVID-19 research articles, which was indicative of the urgency and volume of scholarly work during this period.


A notable observation from the search results is that there were efforts to simulate non-COVID-19 studies published between January 31st and March 31st, 2020, offering a comparative perspective on research output in relation to the pandemic's timeline. Additionally, policy analysis papers examined the trade-offs of various measures taken by US states from January 1st to July 31st, 2020, including federal quarantine orders issued for repatriated citizens.


The Altmetric rankings highlighted key papers in natural sciences that gained significant attention during December 2020, reflecting the scientific community's focus on understanding and mitigating the pandemic's effects. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of excess mortality from January 1st to December 31st, 2021, was conducted in four steps, providing an overarching view of the health crisis's impact across different demographics.


This comprehensive search and subsequent synthesis of information offer valuable insights into the academic response to COVID-19 during a critical year, setting the stage for future research directions and policy formulation.
