The comprehensive impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on mental health has been a significant concern during the pandemic. Recent academic research indicates an increase in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression symptoms among the general population during periods of strict lockdown measures. Studies have shown that these effects are not uniform across all demographics; instead, they often exacerbate existing social inequalities, with marginalized groups experiencing more pronounced negative outcomes. The research also suggests persistent challenges such as sleep disturbances and increased stress levels even after lockdown measures have been lifted. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating mental health support into public health strategies to mitigate long-term psychological effects on populations worldwide.
