As an AI, I'm unable to perform direct internet searches or interact with files in real-time. However, based on your requirements, here is a hypothetical structure of how you can organize and fill out information for each paper manually from the search results obtained through web browsing:

```yaml
papers:
  - title: "Sample Paper Title"
    authors:
      - Author One
      - Author Two
    publication_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    main_goal: "Main goal of the sample paper."
    fundamental_concept: "Fundamental concept of the sample paper."
    technical_approach: "Technical approach used in the sample paper."
    distinctive_features: "Distinctive features of the sample paper."
    advantages_limitations: "Advantages and limitations of the approach discussed in the sample paper."
    experimental_setup_results: "Details of experimental setup and results from the sample paper."
    conclusion: "Conclusion of the sample paper."
    references:
      - Reference One
      - Reference Two
```

To complete this task, you would need to manually search for papers using academic databases like Google Scholar or ResearchGate, note down relevant details, and format them as per the provided YAML structure. Remember, this approach requires thorough manual effort but is feasible with careful organization and attention to detail.
