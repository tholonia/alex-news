    publication_date: "January 2010"
    main_goal: "Outline a 'thermodynamics of organized complexity' based on energy storage and mobilization in a coherent space-time structured system maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by energy flow."
    fundamental_concept: "Negentropy, living organization, space-time structure, stored energy, coherence, coupled cycles, thermodynamics of organized complexity."
    technical_approach: "Qualitatively outline the thermodynamics of organized complexity."
    distinctive_features: "Symmetrically coupled cycles in open systems capable of energy storage."
    advantages_limitations: "Advantages include maximizing potential degrees of freedom and minimizing entropy. Limitations may include complexity in implementation."
    experimental_setup_results: "Theoretical framework based on energy storage and mobilization in coherent space-time structured systems."
    conclusion: "The 'k = const.' regime is proposed as the extremum state characterized by maximum Gibbs entropy function and minimum entropy."
