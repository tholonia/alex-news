    publication_date: "January 2010"
    main_goal: "To outline a 'thermodynamics of organized complexity' based on energy storage and mobilization in a coherent space-time structured system."
    fundamental_concept: "Negentropy, living organization, space-time structure, stored energy, coherence, coupled cycles, thermodynamics of organized complexity."
    technical_approach: "Proposing that symmetrically coupled cycles will arise in open systems capable of energy storage."
    distinctive_features: "Equal population of energy over all space-time domains in the 'k = const.' regime."
    advantages_limitations: "Maximizing potential degrees of freedom while minimizing entropy."
    experimental_setup_results: "N/A"
    conclusion: "The extremum state for organized open systems is characterized by the maximum of the Gibbs entropy function."
