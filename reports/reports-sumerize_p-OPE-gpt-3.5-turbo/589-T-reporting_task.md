## What is (Schrodinger's) Negentropy? by Mae-Wan Ho

## Title and Authors of the Paper
The paper titled "What is (Schrodinger's) Negentropy?" was authored by Mae-Wan Ho.

## Main Goal and Fundamental Concept
The main goal of the paper is to outline a 'thermodynamics of organized complexity' based on energy storage and mobilization in a coherent space-time structured system maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by energy flow. The fundamental concept discussed in the paper is the idea of negentropy, which refers to the storage and mobilization of energy in a coherent space-time structured system.

## Technical Approach
The technical approach involves discussing symmetrically coupled cycles in open systems capable of energy storage, and proposing that the equal population of energy over all space-time domains is the extremum state.

## Distinctive Features
The paper discusses the concept of negentropy in relation to living organization, space-time structure, stored energy, coherence, and coupled cycles, presenting a unique perspective on thermodynamics.

## Advantages and Limitations
The paper provides insights into a thermodynamics of organized complexity and offers a qualitative framework for understanding energy storage and mobilization in coherent systems. However, it may be limited in its scope and applicability to specific scientific contexts, and further research may be needed to validate the proposed concepts.

## Experimental Setup and Results
The paper does not provide specific experimental setups or results, as it focuses more on theoretical concepts and qualitative discussions.

## Conclusion
The paper concludes by proposing that the 'k = const.' regime, characterized by the maximum of the Gibbs entropy function, represents the extremum state for organized open systems.
