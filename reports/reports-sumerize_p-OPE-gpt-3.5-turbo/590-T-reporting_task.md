## What is (Schrodinger’s) Negentropy? by Mae-Wan Ho

### Title and Authors of the Paper
The paper titled "What is (Schrodinger’s) Negentropy?" was written by Mae-Wan Ho.

### Main Goal and Fundamental Concept
The main goal of the paper is to outline a 'thermodynamics of organized complexity' based on energy storage and mobilization in a coherent space-time structured system maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by energy flow. The fundamental concept proposed is that symmetrically coupled cycles will arise in open systems capable of energy storage, and that for such systems, the equal population of energy over all space-time domains (the 'k = const.' regime) is the extremum state.

### Technical Approach
The paper utilizes a thermodynamic approach to analyze organized complexity, focusing on energy storage and mobilization in coherent space-time structured systems. It discusses the 'k = const.' regime and the maximum of the Gibbs entropy function as key technical aspects.

### Distinctive Features
The distinctive features of the paper include the introduction of the concept of 'Negentropy', living organization, space-time structure, stored energy, coherence, coupled cycles, and the thermodynamics of organized complexity.

### Advantages and Limitations
The advantages of the approach presented in the paper include a new perspective on thermodynamics and organized complexity. However, limitations may arise in the practical application of the theoretical concepts proposed.

### Experimental Setup and Results
The paper does not focus on experimental setups or results but rather on theoretical frameworks and concepts related to thermodynamics and organized complexity.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the paper provides a thought-provoking analysis of the thermodynamics of organized complexity and introduces the concept of 'Negentropy' as a key aspect of living organization.
